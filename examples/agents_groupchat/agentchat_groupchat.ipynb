      "Under product development and market research, we can explore the possibility of creating various prototypes to match the needs of different customer segments within the e-bike market. For urban commuters, a focus on speed and battery life would be crucial, while for weekend riders, comfort and ease of use could be key selling points. Additionally, looking into collaborations with well-known brands could help fast-track our product development process, giving us a competitive edge.\n",

People love feeling heard and appreciated, and such an approach will not only enhance our customer relationships but could also turn into great advocacy marketing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Along those lines, also think about hosting webinars or live Q&A sessions, where we could talk about and showcase our e-bikes, discuss their features, benefits, and answer any customer queries. \n",

      "Also agree on focusing on a user-friendly, visually appealing, and informative website being crucial in capturing potential customers researching e-bikes online.
